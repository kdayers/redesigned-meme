@article{Ayers2013,
	Abstract = {The term ``hybrid system'' refers to a continuous time dynamical system that undergoes Markovian perturbations at discrete time intervals. In this paper, we find that under the right formulation, a hybrid system can be treated as a dynamical system on a compact space. This allows us to study its limit sets. We examine the Morse decompositions of hybrid systems, find a sufficient condition for the existence of a non-trivial Morse decomposition, and study the Morse sets of such a decomposition. Finally, we consider the case in which the Markovian perturbations are small, showing that trajectories in a hybrid system with small perturbations behave similarly to those of the unperturbed dynamical system.},

@article{discretesystems,
	Abstract = {Using a directed graph, a Markov chain can be treated as a dynamical system over a compact space of bi-infinite sequences, with a flow given by the left shift of a sequence. In this paper, we show that the Morse sets of the finest Morse decomposition on this space can be related to communicating classes of the directed graph by considering lifting the communicating classes to the shift space. Finally, we prove that the flow restricted to these Morse sets is chaotic.},
