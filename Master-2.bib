	Abstract = {Understanding the molecular programs that guide cellular differentiation during development is a major goal of modern biology. Here, we introduce an approach, WADDINGTON-OT, based on the mathematics of optimal transport, for inferring developmental landscapes, probabilistic cellular fates and dynamic trajectories from large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected along a time course. We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neural- and placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.},

@article{Ayers2013,
	Abstract = {The term ``hybrid system'' refers to a continuous time dynamical system that undergoes Markovian perturbations at discrete time intervals. In this paper, we find that under the right formulation, a hybrid system can be treated as a dynamical system on a compact space. This allows us to study its limit sets. We examine the Morse decompositions of hybrid systems, find a sufficient condition for the existence of a non-trivial Morse decomposition, and study the Morse sets of such a decomposition. Finally, we consider the case in which the Markovian perturbations are small, showing that trajectories in a hybrid system with small perturbations behave similarly to those of the unperturbed dynamical system.},

	Abstract = {Using a directed graph, a Markov chain can be treated as a dynamical system over a compact space of bi-infinite sequences, with a flow given by the left shift of a sequence. In this paper, we show that the Morse sets of the finest Morse decomposition on this space can be related to communicating classes of the directed graph by considering lifting the communicating classes to the shift space. Finally, we prove that the flow restricted to these Morse sets is chaotic.},
